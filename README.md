We have 2 codes: the main is ICECREAM and the Aryan_ice_cream_code is an additional one cause we had time!

### Who are our customers?
```
This program is our take on the online ordering frenzy of 2025. Now, you can order ice cream online! Our audience does not have a specific range of ages or demographics: everyone can enjoy ice cream! This program is designed for the tech-savvy person who would love a cold, refreshing dessert anytime. They can customize every aspect of their dessert, from size to flavor to toppings. Our program will also apply discounts and deals automatically for the customer's comfort. 
```

### What does the program do?

```
The program serves essentially as an online menu, where the customer can pick and choose what ice cream they want, what toppings, and how many they want as well. It will ask a series of questions regarding their order, where they respond based on what food or toppings they would like. At the end, the program prints the user's order, as well as their total and any discounts they may have.
